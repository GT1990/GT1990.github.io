Using a react front end client and an express server for the backend api. \n \n *The express app is hosted on Heroku so the api might take a few seconds to load as Heroku reruns the api.* \n \n The application displays courses allowing users to sign up/in to an account, which allows them to create, update, or delete their own courses. Any user can view all courses without signing in. However, only the course owner has access to make updates or delete thier own course. To create a course you must be signed in.",
